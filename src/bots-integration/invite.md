3. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization page. Here, you'll need to select the server where you want to add the bot and grant the necessary permissions.
4. Once you've authorized the bot, return to the UP3T dashboard.

## Step 3: Register the Bot on Discord

1. In any channel of your Discord server, type the command `!register`.
2. The bot will send you a Direct Message (DM) containing an 8-digit PIN. This PIN is used to verify and link your Discord server to the UP3T dashboard.
